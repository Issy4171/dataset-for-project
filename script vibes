🎤 Group Presentation Script (Spotify Wrapped for the Music Industry)
Speaker 1 – The Hook & Hypothesis (Beginning)

“Imagine opening your Spotify Wrapped — but instead of your music, it’s the entire industry’s.

Our hypothesis was simple: the decline of physical music sales was caused by the rise of digital and streaming platforms, which emerged as the new dominant revenue stream.

Here on this line chart, you can see exactly why we thought that. Physical sales — the CDs and vinyls — fall sharply. Meanwhile, streaming, which barely existed at first, shoots upward. The crossover point tells the story: streaming didn’t just appear, it replaced physical as the main way people consumed music.”

Speaker 2 – General Trends (Middle Part 1)

“Now let’s dig into genres.

This treemap splits the industry between physical and streaming. We see that Rock and Jazz hold on much longer in physical sales — their fanbases were slower to shift. But in streaming, Pop and Hip-Hop dominate.

So the decline wasn’t even across the board. It depended on which genres were able to adapt to the digital shift. For record labels and artists, this meant survival often depended on being in the right genre for the right format.”

Speaker 3 – Spotify Wrapped Dashboard (Middle Part 2)

“Let’s make this interactive — just like Spotify Wrapped, we can pick a year with this slicer.

In [pick a year], the top physical artist was [X], while the top streaming artist was [Y]. Genres show the same split — Rock or Classical still strong in physical, but Pop dominates streaming.

This contrast makes it clear: streaming didn’t just change how people listened. It changed who succeeded. Artists and genres rose and fell depending on how quickly they found an audience online.”

Speaker 4 – Wrap-Up & Conclusion (End)

“So, what did we find?

Our conclusion is that technological innovation, particularly in streaming, didn’t just disrupt the industry — it fundamentally reshaped it. Yes, CDs and physical sales collapsed. But streaming sparked a new era of growth, reviving revenues and reshuffling the stars of the industry.

To borrow Spotify’s language: if the music industry had a Wrapped, the #1 artist would be streaming itself. And that’s how technology transformed the soundtrack of an entire generation.”
