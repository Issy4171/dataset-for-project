Criterion 3: Measures quality

We didn’t just rely on default aggregations (like SUM). We wrote custom DAX to answer deeper questions.

Example: To find the Top Artist by Year, we created this measure:

Top Artist by Year :=
VAR tArtists =
    ADDCOLUMNS(
        SUMMARIZE('music_physical_vs_streaming', 'music_physical_vs_streaming'[Artist]),
        "__Sales", [Total Sales]
    )
VAR topRow =
    TOPN(1, tArtists, [__Sales], DESC)
RETURN
IF(
    ISBLANK([Total Sales]),
    "—",
    CONCATENATEX(topRow, 'music_physical_vs_streaming'[Artist], ", ")
)


✅ This goes beyond a simple SUM:

It groups artists,

ranks them by total sales,

and returns only the top artist for the selected year (using slicer).

This measure is central to our “Spotify Wrapped” board — it personalises the experience year by year, just like the real Wrapped feature
